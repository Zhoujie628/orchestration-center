"""Ports the orchestration application owns; adapters implement them.

The application layer (``orchestrate.server``, ``orchestrate.core``) depends on
this module only. Concrete databases are knowledge of the adapters, so a new
backend is added without touching business code.

Ports are split per repository rather than folded into one fat interface, so a
backend implements exactly the capabilities it really has (the file backend has
no user store; only the SQL backends do).
